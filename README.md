## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In my spare time I am actively working on my programming skills and (offensive) security knowledge by creating fun projects and pwning boxes on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/12323fdsverv).

- :crab: Iâ€™m currently working on a E2EE IRC chat server build in Rust and PGP.
- :dizzy: Iâ€™m learning Rust, Elixir, Javascript, Bash and many more programming languages.
- :heart_eyes: Offensive Security
- :purple_heart: Emacs ftw!
